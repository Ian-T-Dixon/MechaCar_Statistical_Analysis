R Statistical Analysis of the MechaCar


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression MPG]()
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
  
![Total Summary]() ![Lot Summary]()
   
Total Manufacturing PSI: Total Manufaccturing PSI = 62.29 which is below 100, therefore total manufacturing PSI does meet specifcications.
  
 
  
- Lot 1: Manufaccturing PSI = 0.98 which is well below 100, therefore <b>lot 1 manufacturing PSI does meet specifcications.</b>
  
- Lot 2: Manufaccturing PSI = 7.47 which is well below 100, therefore <b>lot 2 manufacturing PSI does meet specifcications.</b>
  
- Lot 3: Manufaccturing PSI = 170.29 which is well above 100, therefore <b>lot 3 manufacturing PSI does NOT meet specifcications.</b
